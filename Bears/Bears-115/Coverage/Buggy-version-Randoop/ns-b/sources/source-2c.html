&nbsp;/** 
&nbsp; * Readable interface for an interval of time between two instants.
&nbsp; * &lt;p&gt;
&nbsp; * A time interval represents a period of time between two instants.
&nbsp; * Intervals are inclusive of the start instant and exclusive of the end.
&nbsp; * The end instant is always greater than or equal to the start instant.
&nbsp; * &lt;p&gt;
&nbsp; * Intervals have a fixed millisecond duration.
&nbsp; * This is the difference between the start and end instants.
&nbsp; * The duration is represented separately by {@link ReadableDuration}.
&nbsp; * As a result, intervals are not comparable.
&nbsp; * To compare the length of two intervals, you should compare their durations.
&nbsp; * &lt;p&gt;
&nbsp; * An interval can also be converted to a {@link ReadablePeriod}.
&nbsp; * This represents the difference between the start and end points in terms of fields
&nbsp; * such as years and days.
&nbsp; * &lt;p&gt;
&nbsp; * Methods that are passed an interval as a parameter will treat &lt;code&gt;null&lt;/code&gt;
&nbsp; * as a zero length interval at the current instant in time.
