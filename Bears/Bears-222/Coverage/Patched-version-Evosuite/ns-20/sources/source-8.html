&nbsp;/**
&nbsp; * Provides a weighted view of a graph. The class stores edge weights internally. All @link{getEdgeWeight} calls are handled
&nbsp; * by this view; all other graph operations are propagated to the graph backing this view.
&nbsp; *
&nbsp; * &lt;p&gt;
&nbsp; * This class can be used to make an unweighted graph weighted, to override
&nbsp; * the weights of a weighted graph, or to provide different weighted views of the same underlying graph.
&nbsp; * For instance, the edges of a graph representing a road network might have two weights associated with them: a travel
&nbsp; * time and a travel distance. Instead of creating two weighted graphs of the same network, one would simply create two
&nbsp; * weighted views of the same underlying graph.
&nbsp; *
&nbsp; * &lt;p&gt;
&nbsp; * This class offers two ways to associate a weight with an edge:
&nbsp; * &lt;ol&gt;
&nbsp; *     &lt;li&gt;Explicitly through a map which contains a mapping from an edge to a weight&lt;/li&gt;
&nbsp; *     &lt;li&gt;Implicitly through a function which computes a weight for a given edge&lt;/li&gt;
&nbsp; * &lt;/ol&gt;
&nbsp; * In the first way, the map is used to lookup edge weights. In the second way, a function is provided to calculate the
&nbsp; * weight of an edge. If the map does not contain a particular edge, or the function does not provide a weight for a
&nbsp; * particular edge, the @link{getEdgeWeight} call is propagated to the backing graph.
&nbsp; *
&nbsp; * Finally, the view provides a @link{setEdgeWeight} method. This method behaves differently depending on how the view
&nbsp; * is constructed. See @link{setEdgeWeight} for details.
&nbsp; *
&nbsp; * @param &lt;V&gt; the graph vertex type
&nbsp; * @param &lt;E&gt; the graph edge type
