&nbsp;    
&nbsp;    //@// An EncryptedDataKey object abstractly contains 3 pieces of data.
&nbsp;    //@// These are represented by 3 byte arrays:
&nbsp;    
&nbsp;    //@ model public instance byte[] providerId;
&nbsp;    //@ model public instance byte[] providerInformation;
&nbsp;    //@ model public instance byte[] encryptedDataKey;
&nbsp;    
&nbsp;    //@// The fields of an EncryptedDataKey may be populated via deserialization. The
&nbsp;    //@// Encryption SDK design allows the deserialization routine to be called repeatedly,
&nbsp;    //@// each call trying to fill in information that for some reason was not possible
&nbsp;    //@// with the previous call. In some such &quot;intermediate&quot; states, the deserialization
&nbsp;    //@// is incomplete in a way that other methods don&#39;t expect. Therefore, those methods
&nbsp;    //@// should not be called in these incomplete intermediate states. The model field
&nbsp;    //@// isDeserializing is true in those incomplete intermediate states, and it is used
&nbsp;    //@// in method specifications.
&nbsp;    //@ public model instance boolean isDeserializing;
&nbsp;
&nbsp;    //@// There are some complications surrounding the representations of strings versus
&nbsp;    //@// byte arrays. The serialized form in message headers is always a sequence of
&nbsp;    //@// bytes, but the EncryptedDataKey interface (and some other methods)
&nbsp;    //@// expose the provider ID as if it were a string. Conversions (using UTF-8)
&nbsp;    //@// between byte arrays and strings (which in Java use UTF-16) are not bijections.
&nbsp;    //@// For example, both &quot;\u003f&quot;.getBytes() and &quot;\ud800&quot;.getBytes() yield a 1-byte
&nbsp;    //@// array containing [0x3f], and calling `new String(..., StandardCharsets.UTF_8)`
&nbsp;    //@// with either the 1-byte array [0x80] or the 3-byte array [0xef,0xbf,0xbd] yields
&nbsp;    //@// the string &quot;\ufffd&quot;. Therefore, all we can say about these conversions
&nbsp;    //@// is that a given byte[]-String pair satisfies a conversion relation.
&nbsp;    //@//
&nbsp;    //@// The model functions &quot;ba2s&quot; and &quot;s2ba&quot; are used to specify the conversions
&nbsp;    //@// between byte arrays and strings:
&nbsp;    /*@ public normal_behavior
&nbsp;      @   requires s != null;
&nbsp;      @   ensures \result != null;
&nbsp;      @ function
&nbsp;      @ public model static byte[] s2ba(String s) {
&nbsp;      @   return s.getBytes(StandardCharsets.UTF_8);
&nbsp;      @ }

&nbsp;      @ function
&nbsp;      @ public model static String ba2s(byte[] ba) {
&nbsp;      @   return new String(ba, StandardCharsets.UTF_8);
&nbsp;      @ }
&nbsp;      @*/
&nbsp;    //@// The &quot;ba2s&quot; and &quot;s2ba&quot; are given function bodies above, but the verification
&nbsp;    //@// does not rely on these function bodies directly. Instead, the code (in KeyBlob)
&nbsp;    //@// uses &quot;assume&quot; statements when it necessary to connect these functions with
&nbsp;    //@// copies of their bodies that appear in the code. This is a limitation of JML.
&nbsp;    //@//
&nbsp;    //@// One of the properties that holds of &quot;s2ba(s)&quot; is that its result depends not
&nbsp;    //@// on the particular String reference &quot;s&quot; being passed in, but only the contents
&nbsp;    //@// of the string referenced by &quot;s&quot;. This property is captured in the following
&nbsp;    //@// lemma:
&nbsp;    /*@ public normal_behavior
&nbsp;      @   requires s != null &amp;&amp; t != null &amp;&amp; String.equals(s, t);
&nbsp;      @   ensures Arrays.equalArrays(s2ba(s), s2ba(t));
&nbsp;      @ pure
&nbsp;      @ public model static void lemma_s2ba_depends_only_string_contents_only(String s, String t);
&nbsp;      @*/
&nbsp;    //@//
&nbsp;    //@// As a specification convenience, the model function &quot;ba2s2ba&quot; uses the two
&nbsp;    //@// model functions above to convert from a byte array to a String and then back
&nbsp;    //@// to a byte array. As mentioned above, this does not always result in a byte
&nbsp;    //@// array with the original contents. The &quot;assume&quot; statements about the conversion
&nbsp;    //@// functions need to be careful not to assume too much.
&nbsp;    /*@ public normal_behavior
&nbsp;      @   requires ba != null;
&nbsp;      @   ensures \result == s2ba(ba2s(ba));
&nbsp;      @ function
&nbsp;      @ public model static byte[] ba2s2ba(byte[] ba) {
&nbsp;      @   return s2ba(ba2s(ba));
&nbsp;      @ }
&nbsp;      @*/    
&nbsp;    
&nbsp;    //@// Here follows 3 methods that access the abstract values of interface properties.
&nbsp;    //@// Something to note about these methods is that each one requires the property
&nbsp;    //@// requested to be known to be non-null. For example, &quot;getProviderId&quot; is only allowed
&nbsp;    //@// to be called when &quot;providerId&quot; is known to be non-null.
