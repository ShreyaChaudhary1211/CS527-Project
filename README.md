| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| Feb 2, 2024  | Shrushti, Sejal, Shreya, Andres  | First meeting - no pre-assigned tasks except for background research about the project, which was completed by everyone. In the meeting we explored the Bears and other datasets together as a starter activity   | Distributed the work: Andres has to commit all details related to Defects4J and Bears; Shrushti- ManySStuBs4J, Sejal - QuixBugs and Shreya - BugSwarm. Shrushti, Sejal and Shreya will update the overleaf draft of the paper  |
| Feb 6 & 7, 2024  | Shrushti, Sejal, Shreya, Andres, Ashwin  |  Every task was in track for completion within 24 hours. Ashwin joined the group a bit late, and he helped us completing tasks of writing scripts and updating overleaf report.  | Update README with details about the dataset and the bugs. Also, update overleaf document with the same  |
| Feb 16, 2024  | Shrushti, Sejal, Shreya, Andres, Ashwin  | First meeting for Milestone2- no pre-assigned tasks except for background research about the next steps to be done, which was completed by everyone. | Distributed the work: Andres will focus on reordering and creating the dataset as per structure given for Bears; Shrushti and Ashwin will do the same for Defects4J, Sejal - QuixBugs and Shreya - BugSwarm. We will get back together again in a meeting once individual progresses are reported, and start working on part 2 of the milestone|
| Feb 25, 2024  | Shrushti, Sejal, Shreya, Andres, Ashwin  | Everyone had started the tasks assigned from the previous meeting. We discussed all the doubts we had and changes we needed to do for figuring out tests that failed for each bug. | Andres is working on completing and committing updated Bears repository, Shrushti and Ashwin- Defects4J, Shreya - BugSwarm and Sejal - QuixBugs. We will meet in two days with next update. |
| Mar 3, 2024  | Shrushti, Sejal, Shreya, Andres, Ashwin  | Everyone had almost finished the tasks assigned from the previous meeting. We needed to write the script to automate running metrics given a bug dataset and bug name. Cleaning up the code for all the metric calculations | Andres is working on cleaning up the code for Bears benchmarking, Shrushti and Sejal- making sure the benchmarking scripts are running for Defects4J and QuixBugs, Shreya - BugSwarm and Ashwin - writing the automate script with next update. |
| Mar 5, 2024  | Shrushti, Sejal, Shreya, Andres, Ashwin  | All tasks were completed, we discussed some final changes and distributed the work for data visualizations & overleaf report | Commit everything and update overleaf. (which is now completed) |
| Mar 18, 2024  | Shrushti, Sejal, Shreya, Andres  | First meeting for Milestone 3- no pre-assigned tasks except for background research about the next steps to be done, which was completed by everyone. | Distributed the work as follows: Andres and Shreya will work on Randoop and Shrushti and Sejal will work with EvoSuite. |
| Mar 27, 2024  | Shrushti, Sejal, Shreya, Andres  | Everyone has already started working on their project sections. During the meeting we discussed the errors each sub-team was facing and tried to fix them as a group. We also discussed how we will move ahead with the project| Shrushti and Sejal will complete EvoSuite test generation and Shreya and Andres will complete Randoop. Andres has added some initial scripts to setup the projet for test generation. Then we will move ahead with task 3. |
| Mar 28, 2024  | Shrushti, Sejal, Shreya, Andres  | We discussed the errors each sub-team was facing and tried to fix them as a group. We also have started committing updates that we are sure of to the repository | Shrushti and Sejal will complete EvoSuite test generation and Shreya and Andres will complete Randoop. Everyone is working on writing scripts for their part. |
| Mar 31, 2024  | Shrushti, Sejal, Shreya, Andres  | The base scripts that generate evosuite and randoop tests have been created. We went back and checked each project to ensure tests were passing/failing as expected. | Randoop generation for Defects4J will now be done by Shrushti and Sejal. Andres will take over evosuite tests for Bears and Shreya Bugswarm respectively. Scripts will be enhanced to cover additional tasks such as proper placement of tests and running the tests to verify them |
| April 5, 2024  | Shrushti, Sejal, Shreya, Andres  | We are opting in for the extension as BugSwarm dataset was not completed before the deadline. QuixBugs stands 100% done, Defects4J and Bears were done, but we are going to try to re-generate them to get better test results and coverage. | Andres will be working on finalizing Bears, Shrushti and Sejal on Defects4J and Shreya will do the BugSwarm repo. (Everyone will work on Evosuite and Randoop both) |
| April 9, 2024  | Shrushti, Sejal, Shreya, Andres  | Bears (Andres) and Defects4J (Shrushti & Sejal) were committed to the repository. Bugswarm (Shreya) was still incomplete (failing tests not updated, no coverage reports) so the team had to jump in to help and try to finish as much as it was possible in a few hours before deadline | Andres and Sejal helped Shreya complete BugSwarm, and Shrushti worked on generating final visualizations and the report |
| April 14, 2024  | Shrushti, Sejal, Shreya, Andres  | First meeting for Milestone 4- no pre-assigned tasks except for background research about the next steps to be done. We discussed how to proceds with the MileStone4. Shrushti, Andres and Sejal will select the bugs and start collecting coverage information for them (Datasets: QuixBugs, Bears & Defects4J). Shreya is trying to re-generate evosuite and randoop tests for Bugswarm as in the last milestone no error-revealing/ regression tests were generated that matched our search criteria. | For all: Complete bug selection & collect coverage information. Shreya will find bugs that match our criteria before moving on to bug selection. |
| April 22, 2024  | Shrushti, Sejal, Shreya, Andres  | Everyone had completed the previously decided tasks- finalizing bugs and collecting coverage reports for those. We met in the library to discuss and decide one approach to follow for calculating suspiciousness scores for every bug dataset. We disucssed the challenges faced in every dataset and resolved them | For all: In the next few days, everyone will finish the Task 1: Bug localization for all the three bugs of their datasets (Bears- Andres, Sejal- Quixbugs, Defects4J- Shrushti & Bugswarm- Shreya). We will meet again to discuss the final results and design the visualizations. |
| April 26, 2024  | Shrushti, Sejal, Shreya, Andres  | Defects4J (Shrushti), Bears (Andres) and QuixBugs (Sejal) - Task1 was completed for the required 3 bugs. For BugSwarm, Shreya is working on task 1 for required 3 bugs | We worked on the visualizations for Task 2. Shrushti, Andres and Sejal will complete the task 1 for next 4 extra bugs for each dataset. Shreya will complete Task 1 for the 3 required bugs, and work on next 4 optional ones as well.  |
| April 30, 2024  | Shrushti, Sejal, Shreya, Andres  | All the bug localization and visualization tasks were completed. In this meeting we worked on finalizing the report contents and deliverables. | No tasks assigned. We will start working on Milestone 5 in a couple of days. |
| May 3, 2024  | Shrushti, Sejal, Shreya, Andres  | No pre-assigned tasks. First meeting for Milestone 5 | We distributed all parts of the presentation & reports equally. Will meet back in couple of days to finalize content and record the presentation |
| May 7, 2024  | Shrushti, Sejal, Shreya, Andres  | The presentation and report were completed by everyone. We recorded the final presentation video and also went through the final deliverables together before submitting them. | MileStone 5 submission completed. No pending tasks - Project concluded. |
