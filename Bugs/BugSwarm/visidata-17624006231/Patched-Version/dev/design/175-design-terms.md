# Types of design statements

1) there are how it already is, which are by design and implemented correctly ('is', 'are')
2) there are the aspirational bits, which are not quite implemented correctly but if an elegant solution were found to do so it would be almost definitely be included ('would ideally')
3) there are the future grand visions, which may not be implemented at all but we need to take into consideration when implementing ('someday', 'eventually')
4) there are the ways that it is, which are accepted for now but are not intentionally by design and may be known as imperfect ('for the time being', 'currently')
5) there are the 'happy accidents', which are nice pleasantnesses but not foundational, they can be dropped if they conflict with some other strogner principle ('as a bonus')
