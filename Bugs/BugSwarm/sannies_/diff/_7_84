>, <Line: - * <li>Presentation, contains IOD which contains a BIFS stream (MP4 file);
>, <Line: - * <li>Sub-part of a presentation, contains an IOD without a BIFS stream (MP4 file);</li>

>, <Line: - * <p>An OD URL may point to an MP4 file. Implicitly, the target of such a URL is the OD/IOD located in the 'iods'
>, <Line: - * atom in that file.</p>
>, <Line: - * <p>If an MP4 file contains several object descriptors, only the OD/IOD in the 'iods' atom can be addressed using
>, <Line: - * an OD URL from a remote MPEG-4 presentation.</p>
