&nbsp;/**
&nbsp; * Abstract implementation of the {@code RememberMeManager} interface that handles
&nbsp; * {@link #setSerializer(org.apache.shiro.io.Serializer) serialization} and
&nbsp; * {@link #setCipherService encryption} of the remembered user identity.
&nbsp; * &lt;p/&gt;
&nbsp; * The remembered identity storage location and details are left to subclasses.
&nbsp; * &lt;h2&gt;Default encryption key&lt;/h2&gt;
&nbsp; * This implementation uses an {@link AesCipherService AesCipherService} for strong encryption by default.  It also
&nbsp; * uses a default generated symmetric key to both encrypt and decrypt data.  As AES is a symmetric cipher, the same
&nbsp; * {@code key} is used to both encrypt and decrypt data, BUT NOTE:
&nbsp; * &lt;p/&gt;
&nbsp; * Because Shiro is an open-source project, if anyone knew that you were using Shiro&#39;s default
&nbsp; * {@code key}, they could download/view the source, and with enough effort, reconstruct the {@code key}
&nbsp; * and decode encrypted data at will.
&nbsp; * &lt;p/&gt;
&nbsp; * Of course, this key is only really used to encrypt the remembered {@code PrincipalCollection} which is typically
&nbsp; * a user id or username.  So if you do not consider that sensitive information, and you think the default key still
&nbsp; * makes things &#39;sufficiently difficult&#39;, then you can ignore this issue.
&nbsp; * &lt;p/&gt;
&nbsp; * However, if you do feel this constitutes sensitive information, it is recommended that you provide your own
&nbsp; * {@code key} via the {@link #setCipherKey setCipherKey} method to a key known only to your application,
&nbsp; * guaranteeing that no third party can decrypt your data.  You can generate your own key by calling the
&nbsp; * {@code CipherService}&#39;s {@link org.apache.shiro.crypto.AesCipherService#generateNewKey() generateNewKey} method
&nbsp; * and using that result as the {@link #setCipherKey cipherKey} configuration attribute.
