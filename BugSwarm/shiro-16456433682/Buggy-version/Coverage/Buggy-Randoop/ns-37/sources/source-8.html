&nbsp;     * &lt;p/&gt;
&nbsp;     * Most programmers won&#39;t use this method directly and will instead rely on the last access time to be updated
&nbsp;     * automatically as a result of an incoming web request or remote procedure call/method invocation.
&nbsp;     * &lt;p/&gt;
&nbsp;     * However, this method is particularly useful when supporting rich-client applications such as
&nbsp;     * Java Web Start app, Java or Flash applets, etc.  Although rare, it is possible in a rich-client
&nbsp;     * environment that a user continuously interacts with the client-side application without a
&nbsp;     * server-side method call ever being invoked.  If this happens over a long enough period of
&nbsp;     * time, the user&#39;s server-side session could time-out.  Again, such cases are rare since most
&nbsp;     * rich-clients frequently require server-side method invocations.
&nbsp;     * &lt;p/&gt;
&nbsp;     * In this example though, the user&#39;s session might still be considered valid because
&nbsp;     * the user is actively &amp;quot;using&amp;quot; the application, just not communicating with the
&nbsp;     * server. But because no server-side method calls are invoked, there is no way for the server
&nbsp;     * to know if the user is sitting idle or not, so it must assume so to maintain session
&nbsp;     * integrity.  This {@code touch()} method could be invoked by the rich-client application code during those
&nbsp;     * times to ensure that the next time a server-side method is invoked, the invocation will not
&nbsp;     * throw an {@link ExpiredSessionException ExpiredSessionException}.  In short terms, it could be used periodically
&nbsp;     * to ensure a session does not time out.
&nbsp;     * &lt;p/&gt;
&nbsp;     * How often this rich-client &amp;quot;maintenance&amp;quot; might occur is entirely dependent upon
&nbsp;     * the application and would be based on variables such as session timeout configuration,
&nbsp;     * usage characteristics of the client application, network utilization and application server
&nbsp;     * performance.

&nbsp;     * &lt;p/&gt;
&nbsp;     * As such, you might consider {@link org.apache.shiro.subject.Subject#logout logging-out} the &#39;owning&#39;
&nbsp;     * {@code Subject} instead of manually calling this method, as a log out is expected to stop the
