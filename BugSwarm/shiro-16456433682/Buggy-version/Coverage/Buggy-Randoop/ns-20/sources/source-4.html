&nbsp; * Callback interface to be implemented by classes that need to perform an
&nbsp; * operation (such as a lookup) in a JNDI context. This callback approach
&nbsp; * is valuable in simplifying error handling, which is performed by the
&nbsp; * JndiTemplate class. This is a similar to JdbcTemplate&#39;s approach.
&nbsp; *
&nbsp; * &lt;p&gt;Note that there is hardly any need to implement this callback
&nbsp; * interface, as JndiTemplate provides all usual JNDI operations via
&nbsp; * convenience methods.
&nbsp; *
&nbsp; * &lt;p&gt;Note that this interface is an exact copy of the Spring Framework&#39;s identically named interface from
&nbsp; * their 2.5.4 distribution - we didn&#39;t want to re-invent the wheel, but not require a full dependency on the
&nbsp; * Spring framework, nor does Spring make available only its JNDI classes in a small jar, or we would have used that.
&nbsp; * Since Shiro is also Apache 2.0 licensed, all regular licenses and conditions and authors have remained in tact.
