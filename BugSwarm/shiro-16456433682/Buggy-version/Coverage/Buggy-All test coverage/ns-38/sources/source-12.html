&nbsp;/**
&nbsp; * A ValidatingSessionManager is a SessionManager that can proactively validate any or all sessions
&nbsp; * that may be expired.
&nbsp; *
&nbsp; * @since 0.1
&nbsp; */
&nbsp;public interface ValidatingSessionManager extends SessionManager {
&nbsp;
&nbsp;    /**
&nbsp;     * Performs session validation for all open/active sessions in the system (those that
&nbsp;     * have not been stopped or expired), and validates each one.  If a session is
&nbsp;     * found to be invalid (e.g. it has expired), it is updated and saved to the EIS.
&nbsp;     * &lt;p/&gt;
&nbsp;     * This method is necessary in order to handle orphaned sessions and is expected to be run at
&nbsp;     * a regular interval, such as once an hour, once a day or once a week, etc.
&nbsp;     * The &amp;quot;best&amp;quot; frequency to run this method is entirely dependent upon the application
&nbsp;     * and would be based on factors such as performance, average number of active users, hours of
&nbsp;     * least activity, and other things.
&nbsp;     * &lt;p/&gt;
&nbsp;     * Most enterprise applications use a request/response programming model.
&nbsp;     * This is obvious in the case of web applications due to the HTTP protocol, but it is
&nbsp;     * equally true of remote client applications making remote method invocations.  The server
&nbsp;     * essentially sits idle and only &amp;quot;works&amp;quot; when responding to client requests and/or
&nbsp;     * method invocations.  This type of model is particularly efficient since it means the
&nbsp;     * security system only has to validate a session during those cases.  Such
&nbsp;     * &amp;quot;lazy&amp;quot; behavior enables the system to lie stateless and/or idle and only incur
&nbsp;     * overhead for session validation when necessary.
&nbsp;     * &lt;p/&gt;
&nbsp;     * However, if a client forgets to log-out, or in the event of a server failure, it is
&nbsp;     * possible for sessions to be orphaned since no further requests would utilize that session.
&nbsp;     * Because of these lower-probability cases, it might be required to regularly clean-up the sessions
&nbsp;     * maintained by the system, especially if sessions are backed by a persistent data store.
&nbsp;     * &lt;p/&gt;
&nbsp;     * Even in applications that aren&#39;t primarily based on a request/response model,
&nbsp;     * such as those that use enterprise asynchronous messaging (where data is pushed to
&nbsp;     * a client without first receiving a client request), it is almost always acceptable to
&nbsp;     * utilize this lazy approach and run this method at defined interval.
&nbsp;     * &lt;p/&gt;
&nbsp;     * Systems that want to proactively validate individual sessions may simply call the
&nbsp;     * {@link #getSession(SessionKey) getSession(SessionKey)} method on any
&nbsp;     * {@code ValidatingSessionManager} instance as that method is expected to
&nbsp;     * validate the session before retrieving it.  Note that even with proactive calls to {@code getSession},
&nbsp;     * this {@code validateSessions()} method should be invoked regularly anyway to &lt;em&gt;guarantee&lt;/em&gt; no
&nbsp;     * orphans exist.
&nbsp;     * &lt;p/&gt;
&nbsp;     * &lt;b&gt;Note:&lt;/b&gt; Shiro supports automatic execution of this method at a regular interval
&nbsp;     * by using {@link SessionValidationScheduler}s.  The Shiro default SecurityManager implementations
&nbsp;     * needing session validation will create and use one by default if one is not provided by the
&nbsp;     * application configuration.
