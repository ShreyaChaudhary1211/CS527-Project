&nbsp;/**
&nbsp; * {@code Executor} implementation that will automatically first associate any argument
&nbsp; * {@link Runnable} instances with the currently available {@link Subject} and then
&nbsp; * dispatch the Subject-enabled runnable to an underlying delegate {@link Executor}
&nbsp; * instance.
&nbsp; * &lt;p/&gt;
&nbsp; * This is a simplification for applications that want to execute code as the currently
&nbsp; * executing {@code Subject} on another thread, but don&#39;t want or need to call the
&nbsp; * {@link Subject#associateWith(Runnable)} method and dispatch to a Thread manually.  This
&nbsp; * simplifies code and reduces Shiro dependencies across application source code.
&nbsp; * &lt;p/&gt;
&nbsp; * Consider this code that could be repeated in many places across an application:
&nbsp; * &lt;pre&gt;
&nbsp; * {@link Runnable Runnable} applicationWork = //instantiate or acquire Runnable from somewhere
&nbsp; * {@link Subject Subject} subject = {@link SecurityUtils SecurityUtils}.{@link SecurityUtils#getSubject() getSubject()};
&nbsp; * {@link Runnable Runnable} work = subject.{@link Subject#associateWith(Runnable) associateWith(applicationWork)};
&nbsp; * {@link Executor anExecutor}.{@link Executor#execute(Runnable) execute(work)};
&nbsp; * &lt;/pre&gt;
&nbsp; * Instead, if the {@code Executor} instance used in application code is an instance of this class (which delegates
&nbsp; * to the target Executor that you want), all places in code like the above reduce to this:
&nbsp; * &lt;pre&gt;
&nbsp; * {@link Runnable Runnable} applicationWork = //instantiate or acquire Runnable from somewhere
&nbsp; * {@link Executor anExecutor}.{@link Executor#execute(Runnable) execute(work)};
&nbsp; * &lt;/pre&gt;
&nbsp; * Notice there is no use of the Shiro API in the 2nd code block, encouraging the principle of loose coupling across
&nbsp; * your codebase.
&nbsp; *
