&nbsp; * A {@code ThreadState} instance manages any state that might need to be bound and/or restored during a thread&#39;s
&nbsp; * execution.
&nbsp; * &lt;h3&gt;Usage&lt;/h3&gt;
&nbsp; * Calling {@link #bind bind()} will place state on the currently executing thread to be accessed later during
&nbsp; * the thread&#39;s execution.
&nbsp; * &lt;h4&gt;WARNING&lt;/h4&gt;
&nbsp; * After the thread is finished executing, or if an exception occurs, any previous state &lt;b&gt;MUST&lt;/b&gt; be
&nbsp; * {@link #restore restored} to guarantee all threads stay clean in any thread-pooled environment.  This should always
&nbsp; * be done in a {@code try/finally} block:
&nbsp; * &lt;pre&gt;
&nbsp; * ThreadState state = //acquire or instantiate as necessary
&nbsp; * try {
&nbsp; *     state.bind();
&nbsp; *     doSomething(); //execute any logic downstream logic that might need to access the state
&nbsp; * } &lt;b&gt;finally {
