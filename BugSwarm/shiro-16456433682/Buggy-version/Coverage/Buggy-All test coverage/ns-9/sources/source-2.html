&nbsp;/**
&nbsp; * Requires the currently executing {@link org.apache.shiro.subject.Subject Subject} to have all of the 
&nbsp; * specified roles. If they do not have the role(s), the method will not be executed and
&nbsp; * an {@link org.apache.shiro.authz.AuthorizationException AuthorizationException} is thrown.
&nbsp; * &lt;p/&gt;
&nbsp; * For example,
&nbsp; * &lt;p/&gt;
&nbsp; * &lt;code&gt;&amp;#64;RequiresRoles(&quot;aRoleName&quot;);&lt;br/&gt;
&nbsp; * void someMethod();&lt;/code&gt;
&nbsp; * &lt;p/&gt;
&nbsp; * means &lt;tt&gt;someMethod()&lt;/tt&gt; could only be executed by subjects who have been assigned the
&nbsp; * &#39;aRoleName&#39; role.
&nbsp; *
&nbsp; * &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;*Usage Note*:&lt;/b&gt; Be careful using this annotation if your application has a &lt;em&gt;dynamic&lt;/em&gt;
&nbsp; * security model where roles can be added and deleted at runtime.  If your application allowed the
&nbsp; * annotated role to be deleted during runtime, the method would not be able to
&nbsp; * be executed by anyone (at least until a new role with the same name was created again).
&nbsp; *
&nbsp; * &lt;p&gt;If you require such dynamic functionality, only the
&nbsp; * {@link RequiresPermissions RequiresPermissions} annotation makes sense - Permission
&nbsp; * types will not change during runtime for an application since permissions directly correspond to how
&nbsp; * the application&#39;s functionality is programmed (that is, they reflect the application&#39;s functionality only, not
&nbsp; * &lt;em&gt;who&lt;/em&gt; is executing the the functionality).
&nbsp; *
