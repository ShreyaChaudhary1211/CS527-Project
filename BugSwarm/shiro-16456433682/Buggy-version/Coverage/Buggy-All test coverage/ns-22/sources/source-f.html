&nbsp;/**
&nbsp; * A {@code SecurityManager} executes all security operations for &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; Subjects (aka users) across a
&nbsp; * single application.
&nbsp; * &lt;p/&gt;
&nbsp; * The interface itself primarily exists as a convenience - it extends the {@link org.apache.shiro.authc.Authenticator},
&nbsp; * {@link Authorizer}, and {@link SessionManager} interfaces, thereby consolidating
&nbsp; * these behaviors into a single point of reference.  For most Shiro usages, this simplifies configuration and
&nbsp; * tends to be a more convenient approach than referencing {@code Authenticator}, {@code Authorizer}, and
&nbsp; * {@code SessionManager} instances separately;  instead one only needs to interact with a single
&nbsp; * {@code SecurityManager} instance.
&nbsp; * &lt;p/&gt;
&nbsp; * In addition to the above three interfaces, this interface provides a number of methods supporting
&nbsp; * {@link Subject} behavior. A {@link org.apache.shiro.subject.Subject Subject} executes
&nbsp; * authentication, authorization, and session operations for a &lt;em&gt;single&lt;/em&gt; user, and as such can only be
&nbsp; * managed by {@code A SecurityManager} which is aware of all three functions.  The three parent interfaces on the
&nbsp; * other hand do not &#39;know&#39; about {@code Subject}s to ensure a clean separation of concerns.
&nbsp; * &lt;p/&gt;
&nbsp; * &lt;b&gt;Usage Note&lt;/b&gt;: In actuality the large majority of application programmers won&#39;t interact with a SecurityManager
&nbsp; * very often, if at all.  &lt;em&gt;Most&lt;/em&gt; application programmers only care about security operations for the currently
&nbsp; * executing user, usually attained by calling
&nbsp; * {@link org.apache.shiro.SecurityUtils#getSubject() SecurityUtils.getSubject()}.
&nbsp; * &lt;p/&gt;
&nbsp; * Framework developers on the other hand might find working with an actual SecurityManager useful.
&nbsp; *
