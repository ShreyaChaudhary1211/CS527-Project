&nbsp;/**
&nbsp; * A {@code PermisisonResolver} resolves a String value and converts it into a
&nbsp; * {@link org.apache.shiro.authz.Permission Permission} instance.
&nbsp; * &lt;p/&gt;
&nbsp; * The default {@link WildcardPermissionResolver} should be
&nbsp; * suitable for most purposes, which constructs {@link WildcardPermission} objects.
&nbsp; * However, any resolver may be configured if an application wishes to use different
&nbsp; * {@link org.apache.shiro.authz.Permission} implementations.
&nbsp; * &lt;p/&gt;
&nbsp; * A {@code PermissionResolver} is used by many Shiro components such as annotations, property file
&nbsp; * configuration, URL configuration, etc.  It is useful whenever a String representation of a permission is specified
&nbsp; * and that String needs to be converted to a Permission instance before executing a security check.
&nbsp; * &lt;p/&gt;
&nbsp; * Shiro chooses to support {@link WildcardPermission Wildcardpermission}s by default in almost all components and
&nbsp; * we do that in the form of the {@link WildcardPermissionResolver WildcardPermissionResolver}.   One of the nice
&nbsp; * things about {@code WildcardPermission}s being supported by default is that it makes it very easy to
&nbsp; * store complex permissions in the database - and also makes it very easy to represent permissions in JSP files,
&nbsp; * annotations, etc., where a simple string representation is useful.
&nbsp; * &lt;p/&gt;
&nbsp; * Although this happens to be the Shiro default, you are of course free to provide custom
&nbsp; * String-to-Permission conversion by providing Shiro components any instance of this interface.
