&nbsp;/**
&nbsp; * A {@code SubjectContext} is a &#39;bucket&#39; of data presented to a {@link SecurityManager} which interprets
&nbsp; * this data to construct {@link org.apache.shiro.subject.Subject Subject} instances.  It is essentially a Map of data
&nbsp; * with a few additional type-safe methods for easy retrieval of objects commonly used to construct Subject instances.
&nbsp; * &lt;p/&gt;
&nbsp; * While this interface contains type-safe setters and getters for common data types, the map can contain anything
&nbsp; * additional that might be needed by the {@link SecurityManager} or
&nbsp; * {@link org.apache.shiro.mgt.SubjectFactory SubjectFactory} implementation to construct {@code Subject} instances.
&nbsp; * &lt;h2&gt;Data Resolution&lt;/h2&gt;
&nbsp; * The {@link SubjectContext} interface also allows for heuristic resolution of data used to construct a subject
&nbsp; * instance.  That is, if an attribute has not been explicitly provided via a setter method, the {@code resolve*}
&nbsp; * methods can use heuristics to obtain that data in another way from other attributes.
&nbsp; * &lt;p/&gt;
&nbsp; * For example, if one calls {@link #getPrincipals()} and no principals are returned, perhaps the principals exist
&nbsp; * in the {@link #getSession() session} or another attribute in the context.  The {@link #resolvePrincipals()} will know
&nbsp; * how to resolve the principals based on heuristics.  If the {@code resolve*} methods return {@code null} then the
&nbsp; * data could not be achieved by any heuristics and must be considered as not available in the context.
&nbsp; * &lt;p/&gt;
&nbsp; * The general idea is that the normal getters can be called to see if the value was explicitly set.  The
&nbsp; * {@code resolve*} methods should be used when actually constructing the {@code Subject} instance to ensure the most
&nbsp; * specific/accurate data can be used.
&nbsp; * &lt;p/&gt;
&nbsp; * &lt;b&gt;USAGE&lt;/b&gt;: Most Shiro end-users will never use a {@code SubjectContext} instance directly and instead will use a
&nbsp; * {@link Subject.Builder} (which internally uses a {@code SubjectContext}) and build {@code Subject} instances that
&nbsp; * way.
&nbsp; *
