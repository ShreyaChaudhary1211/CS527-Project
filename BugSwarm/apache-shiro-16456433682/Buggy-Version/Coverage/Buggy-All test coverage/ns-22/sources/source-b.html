&nbsp; * A {@code SubjectDAO} is responsible for persisting a Subject instance&#39;s internal state such that the Subject instance
&nbsp; * can be recreated at a later time if necessary.
&nbsp; * &lt;p/&gt;
&nbsp; * Shiro&#39;s default {@code SecurityManager} implementations typically use a {@code SubjectDAO} in conjunction
&nbsp; * with a {@link SubjectFactory}: after the {@code SubjectFactory} creates a {@code Subject} instance, the
&nbsp; * {@code SubjectDAO} is used to persist that subject&#39;s state such that it can be accessed later if necessary.
&nbsp; * &lt;h3&gt;Usage&lt;/h3&gt;
&nbsp; * It should be noted that this component is used by {@code SecurityManager} implementations to manage Subject
&nbsp; * state persistence.  It does &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; make Subject instances accessible to the
&nbsp; * application (e.g. via {@link org.apache.shiro.SecurityUtils#getSubject() SecurityUtils.getSubject()}).
&nbsp; *
