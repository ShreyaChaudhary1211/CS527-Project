&nbsp;/**
&nbsp; * &lt;p&gt;An &lt;tt&gt;AuthenticationToken&lt;/tt&gt; is a consolidation of an account&#39;s principals and supporting
&nbsp; * credentials submitted by a user during an authentication attempt.
&nbsp; * &lt;p/&gt;
&nbsp; * &lt;p&gt;The token is submitted to an {@link Authenticator Authenticator} via the
&nbsp; * {@link Authenticator#authenticate(AuthenticationToken) authenticate(token)} method.  The
&nbsp; * Authenticator then executes the authentication/log-in process.
&nbsp; * &lt;p/&gt;
&nbsp; * &lt;p&gt;Common implementations of an &lt;tt&gt;AuthenticationToken&lt;/tt&gt; would have username/password
&nbsp; * pairs, X.509 Certificate, PGP key, or anything else you can think of.  The token can be
&nbsp; * anything needed by an {@link Authenticator} to authenticate properly.
&nbsp; * &lt;p/&gt;
&nbsp; * &lt;p&gt;Because applications represent user data and credentials in different ways, implementations
&nbsp; * of this interface are application-specific.  You are free to acquire a user&#39;s principals and
&nbsp; * credentials however you wish (e.g. web form, Swing form, fingerprint identification, etc) and
&nbsp; * then submit them to the Shiro framework in the form of an implementation of this
&nbsp; * interface.
&nbsp; * &lt;p/&gt;
&nbsp; * &lt;p&gt;If your application&#39;s authentication process is  username/password based
&nbsp; * (like most), instead of implementing this interface yourself, take a look at the
&nbsp; * {@link UsernamePasswordToken UsernamePasswordToken} class, as it is probably sufficient for your needs.
&nbsp; * &lt;p/&gt;
&nbsp; * &lt;p&gt;RememberMe services are enabled for a token if they implement a sub-interface of this one, called
&nbsp; * {@link RememberMeAuthenticationToken RememberMeAuthenticationToken}.  Implement that interface if you need
&nbsp; * RememberMe services (the &lt;tt&gt;UsernamePasswordToken&lt;/tt&gt; already implements this interface).
&nbsp; * &lt;p/&gt;
&nbsp; * &lt;p&gt;If you are familiar with JAAS, an &lt;tt&gt;AuthenticationToken&lt;/tt&gt; replaces the concept of a
&nbsp; * {@link javax.security.auth.callback.Callback}, and  defines meaningful behavior
&nbsp; * (&lt;tt&gt;Callback&lt;/tt&gt; is just a marker interface, and of little use).  We
&nbsp; * also think the name &lt;em&gt;AuthenticationToken&lt;/em&gt; more accurately reflects its true purpose
&nbsp; * in a login framework, whereas &lt;em&gt;Callback&lt;/em&gt; is less obvious.
&nbsp; *
