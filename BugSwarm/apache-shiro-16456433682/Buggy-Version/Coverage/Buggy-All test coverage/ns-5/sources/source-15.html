&nbsp;/**
&nbsp; * An Authenticator is responsible for authenticating accounts in an application.  It
&nbsp; * is one of the primary entry points into the Shiro API.
&nbsp; * &lt;p/&gt;
&nbsp; * Although not a requirement, there is usually a single &#39;master&#39; Authenticator configured for
&nbsp; * an application.  Enabling Pluggable Authentication Module (PAM) behavior
&nbsp; * (Two Phase Commit, etc.) is usually achieved by the single {@code Authenticator} coordinating
&nbsp; * and interacting with an application-configured set of {@link org.apache.shiro.realm.Realm Realm}s.
&nbsp; * &lt;p/&gt;
&nbsp; * Note that most Shiro users will not interact with an {@code Authenticator} instance directly.
&nbsp; * Shiro&#39;s default architecture is based on an overall {@code SecurityManager} which typically
&nbsp; * wraps an {@code Authenticator} instance.
&nbsp; *
&nbsp; * @see org.apache.shiro.mgt.SecurityManager

&nbsp;     * If the authentication is successful, an {@link AuthenticationInfo} instance is returned that represents the
&nbsp;     * user&#39;s account data relevant to Shiro.  This returned object is generally used in turn to construct a
&nbsp;     * {@code Subject} representing a more complete security-specific &#39;view&#39; of an account that also allows access to

&nbsp;     *                                 throw other AuthenticationExceptions, but the list shows the most common ones.
