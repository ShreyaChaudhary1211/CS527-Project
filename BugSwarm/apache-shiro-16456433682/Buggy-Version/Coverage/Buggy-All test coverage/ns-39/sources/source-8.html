&nbsp; * Data Access Object design pattern specification to enable {@link Session} access to an
&nbsp; * EIS (Enterprise Information System).  It provides your four typical CRUD methods:
&nbsp; * {@link #create}, {@link #readSession(java.io.Serializable)}, {@link #update(org.apache.shiro.session.Session)},
&nbsp; * and {@link #delete(org.apache.shiro.session.Session)}.
&nbsp; * &lt;p/&gt;
&nbsp; * The remaining {@link #getActiveSessions()} method exists as a support mechanism to pre-emptively orphaned sessions,
&nbsp; * typically by {@link org.apache.shiro.session.mgt.ValidatingSessionManager ValidatingSessionManager}s), and should
&nbsp; * be as efficient as possible, especially if there are thousands of active sessions.  Large scale/high performance
&nbsp; * implementations will often return a subset of the total active sessions and perform validation a little more
&nbsp; * frequently, rather than return a massive set and infrequently validate.

&nbsp;     * timeout.
&nbsp;     * &lt;p/&gt;

&nbsp;     * select * from sessions s where s.lastAccessTimestamp &lt; ? and s.stopTimestamp is null
&nbsp;     * &lt;/pre&gt;
&nbsp;     * where the {@code ?} parameter is a date instance equal to &#39;now&#39; minus the session timeout
&nbsp;     * (e.g. now - 30 minutes).
&nbsp;     *
&nbsp;     * @return a Collection of {@code Session}s that are considered active, or an
