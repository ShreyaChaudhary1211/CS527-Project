&nbsp;/**
&nbsp; * A {@code CipherService} uses a cryptographic algorithm called a
&nbsp; * &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cipher&quot;&gt;Cipher&lt;/a&gt; to convert an original input source using a {@code key} to
&nbsp; * an uninterpretable format.  The resulting encrypted output is only able to be converted back to original form with
&nbsp; * a {@code key} as well.  {@code CipherService}s can perform both encryption and decryption.
&nbsp; * &lt;h2&gt;Cipher Basics&lt;/h2&gt;
&nbsp; * For what is known as &lt;em&gt;Symmetric&lt;/em&gt; {@code Cipher}s, the {@code Key} used to encrypt the source is the same
&nbsp; * as (or trivially similar to) the {@code Key} used to decrypt it.
&nbsp; * &lt;p/&gt;
&nbsp; * For &lt;em&gt;Asymmetric&lt;/em&gt; {@code Cipher}s, the encryption {@code Key} is not the same as the decryption {@code Key}.
&nbsp; * The most common type of Asymmetric Ciphers are based on what is called public/private key pairs:
&nbsp; * &lt;p/&gt;
&nbsp; * A &lt;em&gt;private&lt;/em&gt; key is known only to a single party, and as its name implies, is supposed be kept very private
&nbsp; * and secure.  A &lt;em&gt;public&lt;/em&gt; key that is associated with the private key can be disseminated freely to anyone.
&nbsp; * Then data encrypted by the public key can only be decrypted by the private key and vice versa, but neither party
&nbsp; * need share their private key with anyone else.  By not sharing a private key, you can guarantee no 3rd party can
&nbsp; * intercept the key and therefore use it to decrypt a message.
&nbsp; * &lt;p/&gt;
&nbsp; * This asymmetric key technology was created as a
&nbsp; * more secure alternative to symmetric ciphers that sometimes suffer from man-in-the-middle attacks since, for
&nbsp; * data shared between two parties, the same Key must also be shared and may be compromised.
&nbsp; * &lt;p/&gt;
&nbsp; * Note that a symmetric cipher is perfectly fine to use if you just want to encode data in a format no one else
&nbsp; * can understand and you never give away the key.  Shiro uses a symmetric cipher when creating certain
&nbsp; * HTTP Cookies for example - because it is often undesirable to have user&#39;s identity stored in a plain-text cookie,
&nbsp; * that identity can be converted via a symmetric cipher.  Since the the same exact Shiro application will receive
&nbsp; * the cookie, it can decrypt it via the same {@code Key} and there is no potential for discovery since that Key
&nbsp; * is never shared with anyone.
&nbsp; * &lt;h2&gt;{@code CipherService}s vs JDK {@link javax.crypto.Cipher Cipher}s&lt;/h2&gt;
&nbsp; * Shiro {@code CipherService}s essentially do the same things as JDK {@link javax.crypto.Cipher Cipher}s, but in
&nbsp; * simpler and easier-to-use ways for most application developers.  When thinking about encrypting and decrypting data
&nbsp; * in an application, most app developers want what a {@code CipherService} provides, rather than having to manage the
&nbsp; * lower-level intricacies of the JDK&#39;s {@code Cipher} API.  Here are a few reasons why most people prefer
&nbsp; * {@code CipherService}s:
&nbsp; * &lt;ul&gt;
&nbsp; * &lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Stateless Methods&lt;/b&gt; - {@code CipherService} method calls do not retain state between method invocations.
&nbsp; * JDK {@code Cipher} instances do retain state across invocations, requiring its end-users to manage the instance
&nbsp; * and its state themselves.&lt;/li&gt;
&nbsp; * &lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Thread Safety&lt;/b&gt; - {@code CipherService} instances are thread-safe inherently because no state is
&nbsp; * retained across method invocations.  JDK {@code Cipher} instances retain state and cannot be used by multiple
&nbsp; * threads concurrently.&lt;/li&gt;
&nbsp; * &lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Single Operation&lt;/b&gt; - {@code CipherService} method calls are single operation methods: encryption or
&nbsp; * decryption in their entirety are done as a single method call.  This is ideal for the large majority of developer
&nbsp; * needs where you have something unencrypted and just want it decrypted (or vice versa) in a single method call.  In
&nbsp; * contrast, JDK {@code Cipher} instances can support encrypting/decrypting data in chunks over time (because it
&nbsp; * retains state), but this often introduces API clutter and confusion for most application developers.&lt;/li&gt;
&nbsp; * &lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Type Safe&lt;/b&gt; - There are {@code CipherService} implementations for different Cipher algorithms
&nbsp; * ({@code AesCipherService}, {@code BlowfishCipherService}, etc).  There is only one JDK {@code Cipher} class to
&nbsp; * represent all cipher algorithms/instances.
&nbsp; * &lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Simple Construction&lt;/b&gt; - Because {@code CipherService} instances are type-safe, instantiating and using
&nbsp; * one is often as simple as calling the default constructor, for example, &lt;code&gt;new AesCipherService();&lt;/code&gt;.  The
&nbsp; * JDK {@code Cipher} class however requires using a procedural factory method with String arguments to indicate how
&nbsp; * the instance should be created.  The String arguments themselves are somewhat cryptic and hard to
&nbsp; * understand unless you&#39;re a security expert.  Shiro hides these details from you, but allows you to configure them
&nbsp; * if you want.&lt;/li&gt;
&nbsp; * &lt;/ul&gt;
