&nbsp;/**
&nbsp; * A collection of all principals associated with a corresponding {@link Subject Subject}.  A &lt;em&gt;principal&lt;/em&gt; is
&nbsp; * just a security term for an identifying attribute, such as a username or user id or social security number or
&nbsp; * anything else that can be considered an &#39;identifying&#39; attribute for a {@code Subject}.
&nbsp; * &lt;p/&gt;
&nbsp; * A PrincipalCollection organizes its internal principals based on the {@code Realm} where they came from when the
&nbsp; * Subject was first created.  To obtain the principal(s) for a specific Realm, see the {@link #fromRealm} method.  You
&nbsp; * can also see which realms contributed to this collection via the {@link #getRealmNames() getRealmNames()} method.

&nbsp;    /**
&nbsp;     * Returns the primary principal used application-wide to uniquely identify the owning account/Subject.
&nbsp;     * &lt;p/&gt;
&nbsp;     * The value is usually always a uniquely identifying attribute specific to the data source that retrieved the
&nbsp;     * account data.  Some examples:
&nbsp;     * &lt;ul&gt;
&nbsp;     * &lt;li&gt;a {@link java.util.UUID UUID}&lt;/li&gt;
&nbsp;     * &lt;li&gt;a {@code long} value such as a surrogate primary key in a relational database&lt;/li&gt;
&nbsp;     * &lt;li&gt;an LDAP UUID or static DN&lt;/li&gt;
&nbsp;     * &lt;li&gt;a String username unique across all user accounts&lt;/li&gt;
&nbsp;     * &lt;/ul&gt;
&nbsp;     * &lt;h3&gt;Multi-Realm Applications&lt;/h3&gt;
&nbsp;     * In a single-{@code Realm} application, typically there is only ever one unique principal to retain and that
&nbsp;     * is the value returned from this method.  However, in a multi-{@code Realm} application, where the
&nbsp;     * {@code PrincipalCollection} might retain principals across more than one realm, the value returned from this
&nbsp;     * method should be the single principal that uniquely identifies the subject for the entire application.
&nbsp;     * &lt;p/&gt;
&nbsp;     * That value is of course application specific, but most applications will typically choose one of the primary
&nbsp;     * principals from one of the {@code Realm}s.
&nbsp;     * &lt;p/&gt;
&nbsp;     * Shiro&#39;s default implementations of this interface make this
&nbsp;     * assumption by usually simply returning {@link #iterator()}.{@link java.util.Iterator#next() next()}, which just
&nbsp;     * returns the first returned principal obtained from the first consulted/configured {@code Realm} during the
&nbsp;     * authentication attempt.  This means in a multi-{@code Realm} application, {@code Realm} configuration order
&nbsp;     * matters if you want to retain this default heuristic.
&nbsp;     * &lt;p/&gt;
&nbsp;     * If this heuristic is not sufficient, most Shiro end-users will need to implement a custom
&nbsp;     * {@link org.apache.shiro.authc.pam.AuthenticationStrategy}.  An {@code AuthenticationStrategy} has exact control
&nbsp;     * over the {@link PrincipalCollection} returned at the end of an authentication attempt via the
&nbsp;     * &lt;code&gt;AuthenticationStrategy#{@link org.apache.shiro.authc.pam.AuthenticationStrategy#afterAllAttempts(org.apache.shiro.authc.AuthenticationToken, org.apache.shiro.authc.AuthenticationInfo) afterAllAttempts}&lt;/code&gt;
&nbsp;     * implementation.
