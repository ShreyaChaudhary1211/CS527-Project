&nbsp;/**
&nbsp; * &lt;code&gt;AuthorizationInfo&lt;/code&gt; represents a single Subject&#39;s stored authorization data (roles, permissions, etc)
&nbsp; * used during authorization (access control) checks only.
&nbsp; * &lt;p/&gt;
&nbsp; * Roles are represented as a &lt;code&gt;Collection&lt;/code&gt; of Strings
&nbsp; * ({@link java.util.Collection Collection}&lt;{@link String String}&gt;), typically each element being the Role name.
&nbsp; * &lt;p/&gt;
&nbsp; * {@link Permission Permission}s are provided in two ways:
&nbsp; * &lt;ul&gt;
&nbsp; * &lt;li&gt;A &lt;code&gt;Collection&lt;/code&gt; of Strings, where each String can usually be converted into &lt;code&gt;Permission&lt;/code&gt;
&nbsp; * objects by a &lt;code&gt;Realm&lt;/code&gt;&#39;s
&nbsp; * {@link org.apache.shiro.authz.permission.PermissionResolver PermissionResolver}&lt;/li&gt;
&nbsp; * &lt;li&gt;A &lt;code&gt;Collection&lt;/code&gt; of {@link Permission Permission} objects&lt;/li&gt;
&nbsp; * &lt;/ul&gt;
&nbsp; * Both permission collections together represent the total aggregate collection of permissions.  You may use one
&nbsp; * or both depending on your preference and needs.
&nbsp; * &lt;p/&gt;
&nbsp; * Because the act of authorization (access control) is orthogonal to authentication (log-in), this interface is
&nbsp; * intended to represent only the account data needed by Shiro during an access control check
&nbsp; * (role, permission, etc).  Shiro also has a parallel
&nbsp; * {@link org.apache.shiro.authc.AuthenticationInfo AuthenticationInfo} interface for use during the authentication
&nbsp; * process that represents identity data such as principals and credentials.
&nbsp; * &lt;p/&gt;
&nbsp; * Because many if not most {@link org.apache.shiro.realm.Realm Realm}s store both sets of data for a Subject, it might be
&nbsp; * convenient for a &lt;code&gt;Realm&lt;/code&gt; implementation to utilize an implementation of the
&nbsp; * {@link org.apache.shiro.authc.Account Account} interface instead, which is a convenience interface that combines both
&nbsp; * &lt;code&gt;AuthenticationInfo&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;AuthorizationInfo&lt;/code&gt;.  Whether you choose to implement these two
&nbsp; * interfaces separately or implement the one &lt;code&gt;Account&lt;/code&gt; interface for a given &lt;code&gt;Realm&lt;/code&gt; is
&nbsp; * entirely based on your application&#39;s needs or your preferences.
&nbsp; *
&nbsp; * @see org.apache.shiro.authc.AuthenticationInfo AuthenticationInfo
&nbsp; * @see org.apache.shiro.authc.Account
&nbsp; * @since 0.9

&nbsp;     * &lt;p/&gt;
&nbsp;     * This method is a convenience mechanism that allows Realms to represent permissions as Strings if they choose.
&nbsp;     * When performing a security check, a &lt;code&gt;Realm&lt;/code&gt; usually converts these strings to object
&nbsp;     * {@link Permission Permission}s via an internal
&nbsp;     * {@link org.apache.shiro.authz.permission.PermissionResolver PermissionResolver}
&nbsp;     * in order to perform the actual permission check.  This is not a requirement of course, since &lt;code&gt;Realm&lt;/code&gt;s
&nbsp;     * can perform security checks in whatever manner deemed necessary, but this explains the conversion mechanism that
&nbsp;     * most Shiro Realms execute for string-based permission checks.
