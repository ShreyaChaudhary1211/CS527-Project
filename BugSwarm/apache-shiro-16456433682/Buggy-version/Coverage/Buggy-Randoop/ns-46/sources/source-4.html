&nbsp;
&nbsp;/**
&nbsp; * A {@code SubjectCallable} associates a {@link Subject Subject} with a target/delegate
&nbsp; * {@link Callable Callable} to ensure proper {@code Subject} thread-state management when the {@code Callable} executes.
&nbsp; * This ensures that any calls to {@code SecurityUtils.}{@link org.apache.shiro.SecurityUtils#getSubject() getSubject()}
&nbsp; * during the target {@code Callable}&#39;s execution still work correctly even if the {@code Callable} executes on a
&nbsp; * different thread than the one that created it.  This allows {@code Subject} access during asynchronous operations.
&nbsp; * &lt;p/&gt;
&nbsp; * When instances of this class execute (typically via a {@link java.util.concurrent.ExecutorService ExecutorService}),
&nbsp; * the following occurs:
&nbsp; * &lt;ol&gt;
&nbsp; * &lt;li&gt;The specified Subject any of its associated thread state is first bound to the thread that executes the
&nbsp; * {@code Callable}.&lt;/li&gt;
&nbsp; * &lt;li&gt;The delegate/target {@code Callable} is {@link java.util.concurrent.Callable#call() executed}&lt;/li&gt;
&nbsp; * &lt;li&gt;The previous thread state that might have existed before the {@code Subject} was bound is fully restored&lt;/li&gt;
&nbsp; * &lt;/ol&gt;
&nbsp; * &lt;p/&gt;
&nbsp; * This behavior ensures that the thread that executes this {@code Callable}, which is often a different thread than
&nbsp; * the one that created the instance, retains a {@code Subject} to support {@code SecurityUtils.getSubject()}
&nbsp; * invocations. It also guarantees that the running thread remains &#39;clean&#39; in any thread-pooled environments.
&nbsp; *
&nbsp; * &lt;h3&gt;Usage&lt;/h3&gt;
&nbsp; *
&nbsp; * This is typically considered a support class and is not often directly referenced.  Most people prefer to use
&nbsp; * the {@code Subject.}{@link Subject#associateWith(Callable) associateWith} method, which will automatically return
&nbsp; * an instance of this class.
&nbsp; * &lt;p/&gt;
&nbsp; * An even more convenient alternative is to use a
&nbsp; * {@link org.apache.shiro.concurrent.SubjectAwareExecutorService SubjectAwareExecutorService}, which
&nbsp; * transparently uses instances of this class.
&nbsp; *
&nbsp; * @see Subject#associateWith(Callable)
&nbsp; * @see org.apache.shiro.concurrent.SubjectAwareExecutorService SubjectAwareExecutorService
&nbsp; * @since 1.0
