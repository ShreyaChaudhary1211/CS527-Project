&nbsp;/**
&nbsp; * &lt;code&gt;AuthenticationInfo&lt;/code&gt; represents a Subject&#39;s (aka user&#39;s) stored account information relevant to the
&nbsp; * authentication/log-in process only.
&nbsp; * &lt;p/&gt;
&nbsp; * It is important to understand the difference between this interface and the
&nbsp; * {@link AuthenticationToken AuthenticationToken} interface.  &lt;code&gt;AuthenticationInfo&lt;/code&gt; implementations
&nbsp; * represent already-verified and stored account data, whereas an &lt;code&gt;AuthenticationToken&lt;/code&gt; represents data
&nbsp; * submitted for any given login attempt (which may or may not successfully match the verified and stored account
&nbsp; * &lt;code&gt;AuthenticationInfo&lt;/code&gt;).
&nbsp; * &lt;p/&gt;
&nbsp; * Because the act of authentication (log-in) is orthogonal to authorization (access control), this interface is
&nbsp; * intended to represent only the account data needed by Shiro during an authentication attempt.  Shiro also
&nbsp; * has a parallel {@link org.apache.shiro.authz.AuthorizationInfo AuthorizationInfo} interface for use during the
&nbsp; * authorization process that references access control data such as roles and permissions.
&nbsp; * &lt;p/&gt;
&nbsp; * But because many if not most {@link org.apache.shiro.realm.Realm Realm}s store both sets of data for a Subject, it might be
&nbsp; * convenient for a &lt;code&gt;Realm&lt;/code&gt; implementation to utilize an implementation of the {@link Account Account}
&nbsp; * interface instead, which is a convenience interface that combines both &lt;code&gt;AuthenticationInfo&lt;/code&gt; and
&nbsp; * &lt;code&gt;AuthorizationInfo&lt;/code&gt;.  Whether you choose to implement these two interfaces separately or implement the one
&nbsp; * &lt;code&gt;Account&lt;/code&gt; interface for a given &lt;code&gt;Realm&lt;/code&gt; is entirely based on your application&#39;s needs or your
&nbsp; * preferences.
&nbsp; * &lt;p/&gt;
&nbsp; * &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Please note:&lt;/b&gt;  Since Shiro sometimes logs authentication operations, please ensure your AuthenticationInfo&#39;s
&nbsp; * &lt;code&gt;toString()&lt;/code&gt; implementation does &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; print out account credentials (password, etc), as these might be viewable to
&nbsp; * someone reading your logs.  This is good practice anyway, and account credentials should rarely (if ever) be printed
&nbsp; * out for any reason.  If you&#39;re using Shiro&#39;s default implementations of this interface, they only ever print the
&nbsp; * account {@link #getPrincipals() principals}, so you do not need to do anything additional.&lt;/p&gt;
&nbsp; *
&nbsp; * @see org.apache.shiro.authz.AuthorizationInfo AuthorizationInfo
&nbsp; * @see Account
