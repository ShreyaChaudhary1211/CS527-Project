&nbsp;/**
&nbsp; * A Permission represents the ability to perform an action or access a resource.  A Permission is the most
&nbsp; * granular, or atomic, unit in a system&#39;s security policy and is the cornerstone upon which fine-grained security
&nbsp; * models are built.
&nbsp; * &lt;p/&gt;
&nbsp; * It is important to understand a Permission instance only represents functionality or access - it does not grant it.
&nbsp; * Granting access to an application functionality or a particular resource is done by the application&#39;s security
&nbsp; * configuration, typically by assigning Permissions to users, roles and/or groups.
&nbsp; * &lt;p/&gt;
&nbsp; * Most typical systems are what the Shiro team calls &lt;em&gt;role-based&lt;/em&gt; in nature, where a role represents
&nbsp; * common behavior for certain user types.  For example, a system might have an &lt;em&gt;Administrator&lt;/em&gt; role, a
&nbsp; * &lt;em&gt;User&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;Guest&lt;/em&gt; roles, etc.
&nbsp; * &lt;p/&gt;
&nbsp; * But if you have a dynamic security model, where roles can be created and deleted at runtime, you can&#39;t hard-code
&nbsp; * role names in your code.  In this environment, roles themselves aren&#39;t very useful.  What matters is what
&nbsp; * &lt;em&gt;permissions&lt;/em&gt; are assigned to these roles.
&nbsp; * &lt;p/&gt;
&nbsp; * Under this paradigm, permissions are immutable and reflect an application&#39;s raw functionality
&nbsp; * (opening files, accessing a web URL, creating users, etc).  This is what allows a system&#39;s security policy
&nbsp; * to be dynamic: because Permissions represent raw functionality and only change when the application&#39;s
&nbsp; * source code changes, they are immutable at runtime - they represent &#39;what&#39; the system can do.  Roles, users, and
&nbsp; * groups are the &#39;who&#39; of the application.  Determining &#39;who&#39; can do &#39;what&#39; then becomes a simple exercise of
&nbsp; * associating Permissions to roles, users, and groups in some way.
&nbsp; * &lt;p/&gt;
&nbsp; * Most applications do this by associating a named role with permissions (i.e. a role &#39;has a&#39; collection of
&nbsp; * Permissions) and then associate users with roles (i.e. a user &#39;has a&#39; collection of roles) so that by transitive
&nbsp; * association, the user &#39;has&#39; the permissions in their roles.  There are numerous variations on this theme
&nbsp; * (permissions assigned directly to users, or assigned to groups, and users added to groups and these groups in turn
&nbsp; * have roles, etc, etc).  When employing a permission-based security model instead of a role-based one, users, roles,
&nbsp; * and groups can all be created, configured and/or deleted at runtime.  This enables  an extremely powerful security
&nbsp; * model.
&nbsp; * &lt;p/&gt;
&nbsp; * A benefit to Shiro is that, although it assumes most systems are based on these types of static role or
&nbsp; * dynamic role w/ permission schemes, it does not require a system to model their security data this way - all
&nbsp; * Permission checks are relegated to {@link org.apache.shiro.realm.Realm} implementations, and only those
&nbsp; * implementations really determine how a user &#39;has&#39; a permission or not.  The Realm could use the semantics described
&nbsp; * here, or it could utilize some other mechanism entirely - it is always up to the application developer.
&nbsp; * &lt;p/&gt;
&nbsp; * Shiro provides a very powerful default implementation of this interface in the form of the
&nbsp; * {@link org.apache.shiro.authz.permission.WildcardPermission WildcardPermission}.  We highly recommend that you
&nbsp; * investigate this class before trying to implement your own &lt;code&gt;Permission&lt;/code&gt;s.
&nbsp; *

&nbsp;     * then any Subject granted {@code permission1} would have ability greater than or equal to that defined by
&nbsp;     * {@code permission2}.

&nbsp;     * @return {@code true} if this current instance &lt;em&gt;implies&lt;/em&gt; all the functionality and/or resource access
